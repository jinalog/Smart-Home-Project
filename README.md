Smart Home Project with Various Sensors, Create with Arduino
--
###### While I was in University (3rd grade), I made it into a team project. 
###### I have provided the idea of applying line-detection sensor, rain-water sensor and  ultrasonic sensor. And I played a role in creating the source code and implementing the demo model.  
###### Using "ArduBase", I made a "SmartHome" with security features.
The added sensors are ***line-detection sensor, rain-water sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and vibration sensor***.

***Sensor Functions***
1) ***Line-detection sensor***: Line-detection sensor is usually a sensor that can judge whether or not a line is present on a floor. This sensor is used to check whether a door of a house is opened or not.
2) ***Rain-water sensor***: Rain-water sensor is a sensor that detects water coming into contact with the sensing panel and signals it.
This sensor is used to generate an warning if water comes into contact with an through a corresponding sensor.
3) ***Ultrasonic sensor***: Ultrasonic sensor are sensors that can measure distances using ultrasonic waves.
This sensor is used to check whether the door of a room with a safe is opened.
4) ***Vibration sensor***: Vibration sensor can detect vibration or impact and detect when there is a direct impact on or around the sensor. This sensor is used to check whether or not physical impact has been applied to a safe through a corresponding sensor.
